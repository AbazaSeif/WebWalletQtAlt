JSON-RPC WEB WALLET

This is a PHP (no database required) web wallet script designed for use with Cryptonite and its variants.

IMPORTANT

This web wallet does not support client side wallet encryption, it relies entirely on the cryptonited JSON-RPC and stores private keys server side. It should only be used as an alternative to the Qt wallet, but it can work as an online web wallet.

A version of this wallet with client side wallet encryption can be found here: <link not yet available>
